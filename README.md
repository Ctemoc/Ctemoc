- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ctemoc
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how to manipulate systems to do what you tell them, not what they tell you.  Specifically rooting Cell phones tablets and NVRs.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rooting.  Can you root a security camera and NVRs?  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not really able ro collaborate.  I dont think I know enough.  Just sick of machines telling me what I can and can not do, so just searching and learning.
